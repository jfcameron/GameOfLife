Left click on any black screen to add live cell to the game of life.
Left click on blue screen with text to adjust sim. This is the parameter screen.

*IMPORTANT* the simulation is initially paused. Add some life to the screens by left clicking black screens then hit [RESUME] on the parameter screen.

PARAMETER SCREEN CONTROLS:
left click [PAUSE], [RESUME] to pause or resume the simulation
left click Clear to set all cells to black

left click Gen Gosper to generate a gosper gun in the sim. I suggest you Clear before Gen Gosper or the pattern will probably collapse
